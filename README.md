# Final Project
VC Intro to Web Programming - Final Project

This project builds upon Exercise 7, which was a simple to-do list app that accepted form input to create a new to-do list.

## Project Tasks

- [x] Display a form to the user to add todos.
- [x] When a user types a todo into the form and hits submit, the following should happen:
  - [x] A new todo should be displayed below any previous todos
  - [x] Every todo in the list should have a ✅ check button next to it to check off the todo and mark it complete
  - [x] Clicking the ✅ check should change the todo in someway, either marking it green or perhaps crossing it out
  - [x] Every todo should have an ❌ to the right that will delete the todo
  - [x] Clicking the ❌ should remove the todo from the page
